The sustainability implications of food production vary by food system. Different food production types create various ranges of greenhouse gas emissions, spatial disturbance, freshwater use, and nutrient pollution. These environmental pressures vary spatially as well. Not only do these pressures have ecological impacts, but also impacts on human health and wellbeing.\r\nUnderstanding the spatial distribution of environmental pressures from food production can help to inform sustainable and just food production\r\nDeliverables & Products\r\nIn order to support our client, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), our team was tasked with the following:\r\nCreate a single processed dataset with metadata that summarizes the total environmental pressure burden from food production for each food type and each environmental pressure type, for each county in the U.S.\r\nDevelop visualizations to help understand pressure distributions and their co-occurrence with both positive and negative human health outcomes\r\nGenerate AI models to understand food production pressures in predicting health outcomes\r\n1. Processed dataset\r\nAt the beginning of our capstone project, the raw data from NCEAS contained hundreds of separate images that describe the geographic distribution of environmental pressures from food production. Each image separately describes a specific type of food production and specific environmental pressure from that food production. For example, one of these images could describe the distribution of greenhouse gas emissions from the production of eggs, and another might describe the use of freshwater during soy production. In this form, these separate image files are difficult to derive meaning or patterns from. Using tools like R and GitHub, our team worked to make a meaningful data format for analyzing county-level food pressure patterns in the U.S.\r\nFigure 1: Processed dataset.We subsetted the global data to our area of interest, the United States, and aggregated hundreds of these images into a single, tidy, rectangular dataset. This tabular dataset contains: for each county in the US, for each food type, and for each environmental pressure type (such as greenhouse gas emissions or water use), the environmental pressure from food production.\r\nThis example above shows just two rows of our processed, tabular data from Santa Barbara county, although our total processed dataset contains more than 330,000 summarized pressure values covering every county in the US.\r\n2. Visualizations\r\nMaps\r\nUsing the processed dataset, we created a series of maps that show how environmental pressure from food production varies by county across the US. This map below is one example that shows greenhouse gas emissions from all food production types for each county; with red indicating counties with higher emissions and blue representing counties with lower emissions. Maps like this one can be used to visualize the spatial distribution of environmental pressures from food production on the county level and compare exposure to pressures across regions.\r\nFigure 2: Map example showing greenhouse gas emissions due to U.S. food production by county.In addition to geographic maps, another visualization we created to study the relationship between food production and human health are correlation plots.\r\nCorrelation plots\r\nThis visual below is one way our team compared patterns of health outcomes as food production increases. The main takeaway from this correlation plot is that health outcomes in regions of high food production differ across states and regions.\r\nFigure 3: Correlation plot example.3. Random forest models\r\nVariable importance plot\r\nCurious to dig deeper into the patterns we observed in the correlation plots, we used a machine learning technique to better understand which variables are most important for predicting health outcomes. Below is a variable importance plot generated from a random forest model.\r\nFigure 4: Variable importance plot example.The NCEAS Food Systems Working Group is doing important work to investigate the spatial distribution of environmental pressures from global food production. We are excited to have contributed processed datasets that are ready to use for analysis; visualizations to explore patterns between food production and health; and random forest modelling to begin to understand the importance of proximity to food production in predicting health outcomes.\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nFaculty Advisors\r\nDr. Benjamin Halpern (NCEAS Executive Director),\r\nDr. Allison Horst (Bren School of Environmental Science & Management UCSB)\r\nExternal Advisors at NCEAS\r\nGage Clawson, Haley Epperly, Dr. Caitlin Fong, Dr. Melanie Frazier\r\nFurther Support\r\nNCEAS Food Systems Working Group, MEDS Cohort and Staff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The carrying capacity, K, had the second highest sensitivity. We could infer from the results of this model that climate impacts affecting forest pre-canopy closure growth rate or carrying capacity would impact maximum forest size. For example, a warmer, drier climate might induce higher evapotranspiration rates and introduce stress that inhibits the growth of younger trees, thereby decreasing pre-canopy closure growth rate. Climate disturbances that degrade or reduce the available area for forest lands (i.e., through fire, flood, or other means) could lower the carrying capacity. According to this model, maximum forest size would likely be impacted by either of these climate-related impacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Kiel and K.T. McClain (1995): “House Prices During Siting Decision Stages: The Case of an Incinerator from Rumor Through Operation,” Journal of Environmental Economics and Management 28, 241-255.\r\nBackground:\r\nThe construction of a new garbage incinerator in North Andover in the early 1980s was\r\ncontroversial due to the increases in ambient pollution that it would create. Rumors of the\r\nincinerator began after 1978. The construction started in 1981, and the incinerator began\r\noperating in 1985. In Economics, land market theory suggests that local amenities are\r\ncapitalized in housing values, and predicts that the prices of houses located near the incinerator\r\nwould fall compared to the price of houses located further away from the incinerator. By 1981,\r\nyou can assume that all market participants had full information on the upcoming garbage\r\nincinerator, so that housing values had capitalized the upcoming arrival of the incinerator.\r\nData:\r\nThe authors of the paper collected data on prices of houses that sold in 1978 (before the\r\nupcoming construction of the incinerator was public knowledge) and in 1981 (after the\r\nconstruction had started). The key variables for the analysis are: rprice (inflation-adjusted sales\r\nprice of house), nearinc (=1 if house located near the incinerator, =0 otherwise), age (age of the\r\nhouse), land (square footage of the lot), area (square footage of the house), rooms (number of\r\nrooms in the house), and a year indicator (1978 or 1981). These variables are contained in the\r\nCSV file KM_EDS241.csv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Load data\r\ndata_raw <- read_csv(\"KM_EDS241.csv\")\r\n\r\ndata <- data_raw %>% \r\n  mutate(year = as.factor(year), \r\n         nearinc = as.factor(nearinc))\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) OLS regression\r\nUsing the data for 1981, estimate a simple OLS regression of real house values on the indicator for being located near the incinerator in 1981. What is the house value “penalty” for houses located near the incinerator? Does this estimated coefficient correspond to the ‘causal’ effect of the incinerator (and the negative amenities that come with it) on housing values? Explain why or why not.\r\n\r\n\r\n# subset data\r\ndata_1981 <- data %>% filter(year == 1981)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmodel <- lm_robust(formula = rprice ~ nearinc, data = data_1981)\r\nsummary(model)\r\n\r\n\r\nCall:\r\nlm_robust(formula = rprice ~ nearinc, data = data_1981)\r\n\r\nStandard error type:  HC2 \r\n\r\nCoefficients:\r\n            Estimate Std.

The very low p-value indicates that this is a statistically significant result and this estimated coefficient correlates with price. This might correspond to the ‘causal’ effect of the incinerator; however, there are other variables that may contribute to the difference in housing prices as well, which implies the possibility of omitted variables bias.\r\n(b) Location choice of incinerator\r\nUsing the data for 1978, provide some evidence the location choice of the incinerator was not “random”, but rather selected on the basis of house values and characteristics.

The above evidence implies the location choice of the incinerator was not “random”, but rather selected on the basis of housing prices and characteristics.\r\n(c) Estimator biased downward\r\nBased on the observed differences in (b), explain why the estimate in (a) is likely to be biased downward (i.e., overstate the negative effect of the incinerator on housing values).\r\nThe estimate in (a), which is based on the observed differences in (b), is likely to be biased downward because this value captures the impact of other characteristics related to housing price (such as the age and size of the home) other than location relative to the incinerator. Before construction of the incinerator in 1978, homes near the incinerator site were older, smaller, and cost less, on average. Because the previous estimate absorbs the affect of these housing characteristics, it is likely to overstate the negative effect of the incinerator on housing values.\r\n(d) Difference-in-differences estimator\r\nUse a difference-in-differences (DD) estimator to estimate the causal effect of the incinerator on housing values without controlling for house and lot characteristics.

As shown in Figure 1, “El Niño” and “La Niña” represent the extreme phases of the ENSO cycle, where El Niño is the warming extreme and La Niña is the cooling extreme.\r\nFigure 1: Extreme phases of ENSO.The effects of ENSO vary depending on the particular phase: El Niño, La Niña, or a neutral phase\\(^{[3]}\\). During an El Niño warming event, Canada and the norther U.S. become drier and warmer, while the Gulf Coast and Southeast become wetter and more susceptible to flooding (see Figure 2). At the same time, southern Africa becomes dry and warm, shown in Figure 3. On the other end of the spectrum, during a La Niña cooling event, the Pacific Northwest and Canada experience heavy rains and flooding, while the southern U.S. experiences drought. During La Niña Southern Africa becomes wet and cool. These effects can be visualized in the graphics below.\r\nFigure 2: ENSO climate effect on North America.Figure 3: ENSO climate effect on African continent.ENSO has been well documented for centuries and varying research suggests that there is a repeated pattern of SST and atmospheric pressure anomalies that cycle in 2-10 year intervals\\(^{[4]}\\). While there is variability in the literature regarding occurrence of ENSO, this study hopes to use NOAA data to shed some light on the statistical significance of the ENSO cycle.\r\nMotivation\r\nThe climate phenomenon known as ENSO has a powerful influence on global processes. For example, major weather events, such as wildfire and hurricanes, are affected by the ENSO cycle\\(^{[6]}\\) due to large-scale changes in temperature and pressure. Furthermore, by influencing regional weather patterns, ENSO affects worldwide crop yields and agricultural outputs, leading to major implications for the global food system, such as under-nutrition in the global tropics\\(^{[7]}\\). Additionally, variations in sea surface temperatures associated with ENSO have implications for phytoplankton productivity and for fish, resulting in major economic impacts on fishing nations, such as Ecuador and Peru\\(^{[8]}\\).\r\nThe ability to scientifically and accurately predict the phases of ENSO allows for proactive global efforts in response to weather events, economic shifts, and even future human health hazards. The results of this study aim to inform policy and global preparedness regarding agriculture, the economy, human health, and climate change.\r\nData\r\nThis study analyzed free and open source data from NOAA’s National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center. Monthly atmospheric and sea surface temperature (SST) indices were collected over nearly 40 years. Measurements of SST anomalies (in degrees Celsius) are used to examine El Niño Southern Oscillation from January 1982 to October 2021 from four different regions across the equatorial Pacific. As shown in Figure 4, the four regions span from east to west, starting with Niño 1+2 at the western coast of South America.\r\nFigure 4: The four regions of interest across the equatorial Pacific where SST anomalies are measured.\r\n\r\n# read in the raw data (.csv from NOAA)\r\ndata_raw_enso <- read_csv(\"enso_data_raw_1982.csv\")\r\n\r\ndata_enso <- janitor::clean_names(data_raw_enso)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis and Results\r\nLag Analysis\r\nStatistical lag analysis is implemented using the autocorrelation function acf, where the maximum lag duration (in months) is set for the entire time series of the available data. The graphs below represent the autocorrelation of SST anomalies across each of the four regions of the Pacific impacted by ENSO.\r\n\r\n\r\nacf1_2 <- acf(x = data_enso$anom1_2, lag.max = 478,\r\n            main = \"Niño 1+2\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph above displays autocorrelation of SST anomalies for region Niño 1+2, which is the most eastern of the four regions, closest to the coast of South America. Values outside of the blue dotted lines indicate statistically significant autocorrelation among sea surface temperature within the region. We can see that between 0 and 200 lag months (<17 years) there are several significant values. Next, we examine the data for the other regions to see how the autocorrelation compares to Niño 1+2.\r\n\r\n\r\nacf3 <- acf(x = data_enso$anom3, lag.max = 478,\r\n            main = \"Niño 3\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacf3_4 <- acf(x = data_enso$anom3_4, lag.max = 478,\r\n            main = \"Niño 3.4\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nacf4 <- acf(x = data_enso$anom4, lag.max = 478,\r\n            main = \"Niño 4\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs expected, after plotting the acf function for Niño 3, 3.4, and 4, distinct similar patterns are revealed regarding where there is statistically significant SST anomaly lag. Because most of the interesting values across all regions seem to fall within 300 months (25 years), we take a closer look at this time period across the most studied region: Niño 3.4.\r\n\r\n\r\nacf3_4 <- acf(x = data_enso$anom3_4, lag.max = 300,\r\n            main = \"Niño 3.4\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we see statistically significant lag effects around the following times: \\(t-25\\) (~2 years), \\(t-100\\) (~8 years), \\(t-125\\) (~10 years), and \\(t-175\\) (~15 years).\r\nThis preliminary analysis suggests a cyclical pattern where the sea surface temperature anomaly from about 2, 8, 10, and 15 years ago affects the current sea surface temperature anomaly. This outcome is mostly inline with the currently published literature\\(^{[4]}\\), however it’s possible there is an even more defined seasonal pattern.\r\nClassical Decomposition\r\nBecause there seems to be a statistically significant repeated pattern of the ENSO cycle, the next step is to determine whether there is clear seasonality and a significant trend in the long-term data. This analysis is carried out through a classical additive decomposition of the NOAA SST data.\r\n\r\n\r\n# convert to class date in order to create tsibble\r\ndata_enso <- data_enso %>% \r\n  mutate(month = case_when(\r\n    mon <= 9 ~ paste0(0, mon),\r\n    mon > 9 ~ paste0(mon))) %>%\r\n  unite(col = date, yr, month, sep = \"-\") %>% \r\n  mutate(date = yearmonth(as.yearmon(date, format = '%Y-%m'))) %>%\r\n  na.omit() %>%\r\n  select(date, anom3_4) %>% \r\n  as_tsibble(index = date)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndata_enso %>%\r\n  model(classical_decomposition(anom3_4, type = \"additive\")) %>%\r\n  components() %>%\r\n  autoplot() +\r\n  labs(title = \"Classical additive decomposition of ENSO SST anomalies\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs shown in the graph above, the magnitude indicators on the vertical axes indicate the significance of each effect relative to the other components. A large bar indicates a low influence compared to a component with a small bar. According to this decomposition, there appears to be a very quick seasonal pattern, however this seasonality does not have a large influence on ENSO. Alternatively, the trend component does have a major influence although this pattern initially seems less defined. However, looking more closely at the trend component, a repeated pattern every decade or so can be seen across time (shown between 1988 and 2008, for example). This implies that there may be some other “seasonality” that the function is not currently identifying and further research is required.\r\nFuture Research\r\nFuture research aims to expand upon this preliminary analysis of ENSO autocorrelation and seasonality to accurately predict and prepare for major global impacts. To further explore long-term seasonality, the acf function used in the lag analysis may be manipulated to search for seasonality on a greater time scale, such as each decade. While this particular study focuses on SST anomalies, subsequent studies may apply this analysis to atmospheric pressure (the Southern Oscillation) in order to determine if there is a more predictable pattern for other ENSO indices. Additionally, regressing this data with crop yield data could lead to discoveries regarding which crops are El Niño vs. La Niña tolerant, informing major agricultural and food distribution decisions. This study hopes to proactively inform policy and global responses regarding the implications of the ENSO phenomenon.\r\nReferences\r\n1.What is the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a nutshell? | NOAA Climate.gov. https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/what-el-ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93southern-oscillation-enso-nutshell.\r\n2.US Department of Commerce, N.

There are over 13,000 active and inactive landfills in the United States, some located near residential areas. These landfills have the potential to release toxic substances into the air and groundwater, negatively affecting the health and well-being of nearby populations. This raises an important research question which will be addressed in this systematic review: How does the location of a solid waste facility affect the health of humans that live nearby? While a similar systematic review was conducted in 2009 by Porta et. al., a significant amount of research has been published in the past decade, prompting a more recent review to capture the new studies as well. Furthermore, because waste facilities are located disproportionately in minority areas, this systematic review will address this question within the context of prioritizing environmental justice as we continue to build sustainable communities.\r\nSummary of Study Methods\r\nOur team used the PICO/PECO framework in order to formulate our question, where the population of interest is humans; the intervention or exposure is living near a landfill; the comparison is other humans that do not live near a landfill; and the outcome is the effect on human health. In order to find published research regarding this question, we conducted a search on the Web of Science bibliographic database using Boolean operators and wildcard indicators. For the search string itself, various synonyms for landfills and waste facilities were used and several different measures of human health, both physical and mental, were accounted for. Ultimately, our search yielded 5,716 articles. Each title will be inspected in the systematic review, and abstracts and entire texts will be examined as needed in order to determine eligibility for inclusion. The summary statistics from each publication will be tabulated and ultimately presented in a forest plot.\r\nKeywords\r\nLandfill, waste facility, human health\r\nBackground\r\nAs global consumerism continues to increase, the widespread use of single-use plastics and fast fashion contribute significant amounts of waste in today’s society. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), about 300 million tons of trash were generated in the United States in 2018, corresponding to nearly 5 pounds per person per day. This waste must be stored somewhere, and there are over 3,000 active landfills and 10,000 inactive landfills in the United States, some of which are located in close proximity to residential areas.\r\nTitle 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 258 lists the restrictions for a municipal solid waste landfill (MSWLF) in the United States, including location criteria, composite liner requirements, leachate collection and removal systems, groundwater monitoring requirements, among others. While the United States has created some effective measures to sustain safe landfilling, many developing nations do not have the same infrastructure in place. As shown in Figure 1 below, the repercussions of residing near a waste facility may have negative impacts on human health. Unfortunately, the “management of solid waste (mainly landfills and incineration) releases a number of toxic substances” (Njoku et al. 2019). One notable substance is ambient toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which causes malodor and “has been shown to negatively impact the health and well-being of populations” (Heaney et al. 2011). Additionally, “the by-products of solid waste deposited in a landfill have adverse effects on the surrounding environment and humans living closer to landfill sites” (Njoku et. al. 2019), leading to increased risk of congenital anomalies and low birth weight for populations living within two kilometers of landfills (Porta et. al. 2009).\r\nNotably, solid waste facilities are located disproportionately in minority areas (Anderton et al. 1994), specifically in communities of color and low socioeconomic status (Heaney et al. 2011). Addressing the question of how landfills affect human health is critical to environmental science as we decide how to implement future waste facilities across the globe. Perhaps most importantly, we must prioritize environmental justice as we continue to build sustainable communities and minimize the disproportionate impacts on underserved communities around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Conceptual model indicating how living near a municipal solid waste landfill (MSWLF) might lead to negative impacts on human health.\r\nObjective of the review\r\nPrimary research question\r\nThe primary research question that this systematic review protocol focuses on is: what is the effect of landfill location on human health? This question explores the effects of solid waste facilities on human health, including both mental and physical wellbeing. This systematic review does not examine the effects of the disposal site on flora, fauna, or the surrounding ecosystem.\r\nComponents of primary research question (PICO)\r\nThe primary research question components are:\r\nPopulation: humans\r\nIntervention/Exposure: living near a landfill or solid waste facility\r\nComparator: humans that do not live near a waste facility\r\nOutcome: effect on human health\r\nMethods\r\nSearch string\r\nThe complete search string including Boolean operators and wildcards is:\r\n(human$ OR people$ OR population$ OR communit* OR town* OR cit) AND (landfill OR “waste facilit” OR “waste dump” OR “dumping ground” OR dump OR “disposal area”) AND (health OR well$being OR wellness OR happ* OR “mental health” OR “physical health” OR safe*)\r\nTABLE\r\nBibliographic databases\r\nFor this systematic review, Web of Science was used as the bibliographic database, including the institution subscriptions listed below in Table 2.\r\nTABLE\r\nSearch language(s)\r\nThe primary language used to complete this search is English. While this search was not explicitly restrictive to the English language, all search terms are in English; therefore the vast majority of the search results are also likely to be in English. Due to our limited selection of search languages, there is inherent bias in the search and search results as it excludes studies conducted in other languages and likely in other cultural contexts. Articles written in Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish may be relevant to this research question as these languages (along with English) are the six working languages among the United Nations community. However, it may also be relevant to include studies conducted in additional languages in order to account for case studies in developing countries where solid waste facilities have a significant impact on public health. A successful expansion of this search would require collaboration with multilingual scholars who have domain expertise as well as data science knowledge.\r\nWebsites of relevant organizations and supplementary internet searches\r\nTABLE\r\nBenchmark studies to estimate search comprehensiveness\r\nThis following benchmark publication is included in the Web of Science bibliographic search.\r\nGouveia, Nelson, and Rogerio Ruscitto do Prado. “Health Risks in Areas Close to Urban Solid Waste Landfill Sites.” Revista de Saúde Pública 44 (October 2010): 859–66. https://doi.org/10.1590/S0034-89102010005000029.\r\nArticle screening and study eligibility criteria\r\nScreening process\r\nIn this review, we will examine the title of all search results. If the title is insufficient, the abstract will be examined in order to determine eligibility. We will use SysRev to compile results from our literature search. Articles will initially be categorized as (a) include, (b) exclude, and (c) maybe include. Our team will read the articles in full within category (c) in order to determine whether they are appropriate to include. We will evaluate inter-reviewer consistency via the kappa test, with some overlap in article review in order to determine any discrepancies. SysRev will be instrumental in recording whether or not articles meet the inclusion criteria. Inconsistent categorization among different reviewers of the same article will be resolved through a discussion and consensus among the reviewers of that article.\r\nEligibility criteria applied in screening process\r\nPopulation (P) criteria\r\nThe populations studied must be human subjects and may not include any nonhuman species. Studies focused on plants, animals, ecosystems, and agriculture are not eligible for inclusion.\r\nIntervention (I) criteria\r\nThe intervention or exposure of interest is whether the population is located near a landfill or solid waste facility. Studies focused on the effects of radioactive or hazardous waste facilities are not considered for this systematic review.\r\nComparator (C) criteria\r\nThe comparator for this research question is other human populations that do not live near a solid waste facility.\r\nOutcome (O) criteria\r\nThe outcome component explores the effects on human mental and physical health and wellbeing as related to exposure to solid waste facilities. This systematic review excludes studies focused on congenital conditions that are unrelated to landfill location.\r\nStudy design criteria\r\nStudy designs include spatial comparisons of two groups (subjectively distal and proximal to the waste facility), case studies for specific locations, and available health records.\r\nLanguage criteria\r\nAlthough no languages are explicitly excluded, English is the only language included as we are lacking in multilingual collaborators.\r\nTabulated screening criteria\r\nTABLE 4\r\nDocumentation of eligibility\r\nWe will include a full list of all reviewed articles that have been excluded from the systematic review. The citations of the excluded articles will be documented along with the rationale for exclusion.\r\nData coding and extraction strategy\r\nData extraction\r\nIn an ideal case where the paper states the effect size and uncertainty of the study, we will tabulate these statistical values and include this information in the systematic review. For non-ideal cases where the raw data exists but the summary statistics have not yet been calculated, our team will extract the underlying primary data and calculate the average values and standard deviations ourselves.\r\nPotential explanatory variables for heterogeneity among studies\r\nIn order to account for heterogeneity among studies, our team will compile potential explanatory variables along with each of the publications. Potential explanatory variables include population variables that account for social demographics, such as socioeconomic status and race. Income, property value, and educational attainment could be considered indications of wealth and socioeconomic status. While race and educational attainment are categorical variables, household income and property value are continuous and quantitative (unless these values are “binned” into specific intervalled categories). Demographic variables, such as age, race, income, gender, and lifestyle play a major role in determining human health and wellbeing and this review would be lacking if we did not explore the statistical relationships among these variables and the data gathered from our search.\r\nData presentation\r\nA forest plot (or blobbogram) will be constructed to display the findings of the meta-analysis in order to capture the results from many studies and summarize these findings into one schematic. Additionally, a map of landfill locations overlaid with a map of health statistics may be an effective presentation of the results of this meta-analysis.\r\nCompeting interests\r\nThe author declares no competing interests with the proposed research project.\r\nReferences\r\nChristopher D.
